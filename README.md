## About

A Next.Js Web app for crypto-lottery, where users can buy tickets using MATIC cryptocurrency for the lottery, and an admin draws the winner using Solidity Smart contract backend, and thirdweb servers for connecting functionality.
All of the WEB3 transactions are currently registred on MATIC Mumbai (a test-net for the MATIC cryptocurrency) to prevent real currency transactions, other than that transaction real and appear between wallets.
As a lottery admin, you get commision for evey ticket purchased! and you control the flow of the lottery draw.
